# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to improve the integrity of the school district analysis, after discovering that Thomas Highschool's ninth graders' math and reading scores may have been compromised/altered, by removing those scores and replacing them with non-numbers.  We then used the "clean" data to repeat the analysis and improve it's accuracy.


## Results
### How is the district summary affected?
- The Average Math Score in the updated district summary dropped by 0.1 point.
- The Average Reading Score was unchanged.
- The percentage of students who passed math dropped by 0.2%.
- The percentage of students who passed reading dropped by 0.1%.
- The overall percentage of passing students dropped by 0.3%.
